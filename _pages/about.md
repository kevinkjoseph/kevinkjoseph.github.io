Kevin is a multi-disciplinary research engineer who seeks to combine his technical skills as a mechanical and civil engineer(in-progress), and data analytics to create public-policies which help cities govern to become more livable, resilient, and sustainable. Currently, he is a MASc student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) and affliated with [Centre for Global Engineering](https://cgen.utoronto.ca/) studying urban water supply systems with a focus on equality and equity. He is currently developing tools and metrics that can harness water data to influence water policies and emerging practices for data-driven governance and empower policymakers and urban communities to achieve equal and equitable water supply. Before joining the University of Toronto, he completed his B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) and was a researcher at New York Universityâ€™s [Center of Urban Science and Progress](https://cusp.nyu.edu/) and other research groups. His research interests revolve around the intersection of urban water distribution systems, urban infrastructure/systems, sustainability, and public policy.
